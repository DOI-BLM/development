# CFPB front-end team

> A repository for the discussion and publication of the CFPB front-end team standards.

----
## Standards and styles

Over the coming months we'll be establishing standards and style guides 
for working with the front-end of CFPB sites and applications. 
As we do so, we'll be discussing these standards in the [issues](https://github.com/cfpb/front-end/issues) 
of this repository and posting final documents here, 
with the final goal of building something similar to the [CFPB Design Manual](http://cfpb.github.io/design-manual/). 
As a team, we'll be sharing responsibility for this process
and will initially focus on our core competencies:

- HTML & template standards and styles
- CSS/LESS standards and styles
- JavaScript standards and styles

### Deliverables

The initial deliverable will be a Markdown file containing a written version of the proposed standards. In addition to the Markdown file, we may also want to include linting configurations and example files.

### Proposed timeline

- **02/18/2015:** standards kickoff
- **03/02/2015:** first drafts of initial standards complete
- **03/16/2015:** finalized drafts of initial standards complete
- **03/30/2015:** stand up initial cfpb.github.io/front-end/ site
- **03/31/2015:** presentation of initial standards to the development team
- **Beyond:** discussion of libraries, frameworks, testing best practices, monthly reviews

*In the future this timeline will be tracked in the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md).*
